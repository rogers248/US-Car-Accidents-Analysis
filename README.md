We all know that cars are necessary communication method in USA and there are tons of car accidents happening every day. I'm really interested in doing an exploratory data analysis on how different factors might cause car accidents. I will use this US-Accidents dataset to extract cause that contribute to car accidents and how different factors affect the severity of the accidents differently. Additionally, I'll study traffic behavior and accidents espcially during COVID-19 period.
